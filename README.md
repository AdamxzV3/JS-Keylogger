# Anti-Keylogger and Keylogger for Web Browsers

🔒 This repository contains code snippets for creating an anti-keylogger and a keylogger in JavaScript that are connected to a Discord webhook.

## Anti-Keylogger

🛡️ The anti-keylogger prevents keylogging in the browser. It sends a message to your Discord webhook every few seconds to indicate that keylogging has been disabled.
